List of things im currently working on, learning, or just having fun experimenting with.

# Default and Spatial Temporal Graph networks  
GNNs have so many utilities, from leveraging knowledge graphs for recommendations, to modeling spatial and temporal relationships in video data for action recognition. They are a world of their own and really interesting from a technical perspective. Having fun implementing and playing around with them

# Agentic RAG
The goal of this project is to get familiar with docker and minimal UI libraries (e.g streamlit) to serve previously developed models. The idea is to utilize a previously developed fish otolith detection model, make a simple docker and serve it on a basic and easy to use app that supports single image inference, as well as batch inference from a folder.  
A minimal version of this project is already available [here](https://github.com/NMVRodrigues/otolith_detection).
