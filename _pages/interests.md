This page describes my current research interests, regardless of having started to work on them. It can be considered a list of personal interesting projects to learn new domains or techniques.

## Shopping recommendations  
The main goal is to get familiar with vector databases, multimodal LLMs (VLMs) and ranking / recommendation. The idea is to embed multiple image - tag pairs, that describe articles (e.g T-shirt - baggy), so that when queried with a new item or item description, it provides a similar product.

## Model serving
The goal of this project is to get familiar with docker and minimal UI libraries (e.g streamlit) to serve previously developed models. The idea is to utilize a previously developed fish otolith detection model, make a simple docker and serve it on a basic and easy to use app that supports single image inference, as well as batch inference from a folder.
